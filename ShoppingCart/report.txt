This project can be found in the ShoppingCart Folder

Steps:
1. I created 4 main files for this application, shoppingCart.html which was my main landing page with the items
2. checkout.html which is where you can see the final cart
3. shoppingCart.css which holds all the styling information for my application
4. and finally shoppingCart.ts which holds the logic to work the back end.
5. first I worekd with shoppingCart.html in creating the basic layout of the webpage and the elements and I then did the same on checkout.html
6. Afterwards I created all of my different styling classes to achieve the look I had desired
7. I then finally worked out all of the back end logic in shoppingCart.ts

npm is still failing to install both angular and typescript and recognize their keywords as valid. I am still looking to find a fix, however the logic in typescript should be sound.

This report file, all images, and the previous files from other reports are all untracked in the repo.
